1.0
the very beginning version using command line and ad-hoc input.

1.1
the input data and mask are in nifti format, the selectors and regressors are in a text file.
the RT regression part is removed
the flexibility of dealing with different data types is still needed.
the location.bin is not supposed to be there any more, since we have nifti files.

1.2
a huge progress and a lot of changes
add four tasks to use masks to do correlation and activation tasks.
incorporate libsvm code in the toolbox, no more -lsvm.
rewrite part of the svm code, use blas dot product instead of its own, and compute the length of a vector in libsvm before hand, by assuming that all vectors are with the same length. this accelerates the code by about 25%.
rewrite the voxel selection cross validation part, now if using linear svm, the code will use precomputed kernel instead of computing the kernel every fold. this accelerates the code quite a lot, say, from 10 hours to 20 minutes. but if using other kernel, currently the redundant computing is still needed.
add -Wextra -Werror to Makefile to eliminate a lot warnings, most of which are unused variables, unnecessarily passed from the function's input arguments.
add MPI_Barrier to make sure all nodes finish reading and progress together.
put all mask files in a sub directory.
nifti files are in two categories: 1) data, must be in short; 2) mask, can be in short or int.

1.2.1
redesigned the shared memory parallelization
fixed some minor bugs
allowed mask file data type to be float

1.2.2
allow data type of data/mask file to be float
add a new input argument -e to specify the block file directory

1.2.3
fix a bug in SVMPredictorWithMasks.cpp. When computing the correlation matrices in GetPartialInnerSimMatrixWithMasks(), we need to be aware that different subjects may have different TRs, so the col information should be specified in every loop.

1.3
separate the file related functions into a new file FileProcessing.cpp/h.
write voxel selection results in nifti format, produce two files, one stores the voxel sequences, the other stores the voxel scores. a nifti file should be provided as the reference (will copy its nifti_image and only replace nbyter, datatype and data of the struct). the previous voxel list output in txt format is also kept for now. users provide a file prefix of output files, '_list.txt', '_seq.nii.gz', '_score.nii.gz' will be added for three output files.
the previous change also applied to searchlight voxel selection. fixed a bug in searchlight, the voxel location array also needs to be masked when a mask file is applied.

1.3.1
output real values for each test item in test tasks
fix minor bugs in SVMPredictor.cpp

1.3.2
add correlation visualization task (type 8) to generate a 4D nifti file for visualizing the correlation between some voxels in a certain block.

1.3.3
use float instead of double to store the raw data to save memory

1.3.4
bug fixed, don't do zscore when there's only one value

1.3.5
tune the z-score function, add quiet mode in predict

1.3.6
modify the svm prediction function in test mode to be consistent with the one in voxel selection mode --May 8 2014

1.4
modify the data reading procedure to be master reading then broadcasting
be Xeon Phi runnable
add marginal screening as task 9

1.4.1
add matmul function in MatComputation.cpp/h to replace cblas_sgemm for skinny matrix multiplication
rearrange data access sequence in Preprocessing.cpp/h to make better cache usage

1.4.2
add -f and -p to randomly shuffle the data for non-parametric statistical test
add ridge regularization and change the data normalization method in marginal screening task

1.4.3
improve the performance of activity-based searchligt voxel selection (-k 2)
add shuffling to activity-based voxel selection, works as for correlation-based voxel selection

1.4.4
add VoxelwiseAnalysis.cpp/h for better performance (3x faster) of correlation-based voxel selection (-k 0) running on Phi
provide a flag option __MEASURE_TIME__ for printing the matrix multiply, normalization and SVM classification time info for correlation-based voxel selection
1.4.5
replace the intensively used malloc in Phi version with kmp_malloc to release locking issue
1.4.6
add -1 -2 to accept different fmri files as input, now FCMA can take either -d (one directory, correlation within file) or -1 -2 (two directories, correlation between files)
update voxel selection and classification parts accordingly
1.4.7
update voxelwise correlation computing for better data locality
add "#pragma loop count" for better vectorization
update select_working_set in svm.cpp, vectorization is on the way
speedup marginal screening by changing variables from double to float and adding "#pragma simd reduction"
some of the tasks running on Xeon Phi may be slower due to data contention, if happened, decrease the number of voxels handled at once
only voxel selection (task 0) and marginal screening (task 9) is runnable on Xeon Phi now
1.4.8
vectorize select_working_set function in svm.cpp. the number of threads needs to be 60 in svm iteration for exclusive usage of vector process unit
fix a bug in voxelwise voxel selection code

1.5
focus on optimizing code of correlation-based voxel selection (-k 0) for xeon phi
in this version, xeon and xeon phi mixed voxel selection task is NOT supported yet
the default setting is for running on xeon phi, __USE_MIC__ needs to be commented out in Makefile for running on xeon
do getBuf to normalize the activity matrices in master node to save bandwidth and computing time on xeon phi
use predefined space instead of dynamically allocated space to store corelation values to help the compilor's optimization. by doing this, the data contention in 1.4.7 is fixed as well
rewrite z-score function for better vectorization, also eliminate double-float conversion in z-score function

1.5.1
clean svm related code for further optimization

1.5.2
remove unnecessary OMP parallelization in get_Q function of svm.cpp to eliminate __kmp_wait_yield_4

1.5.3
vectorize getting max/min of arrays in select_working_set for MIC using Intel intrinsics

1.5.4
change the data layout of correlation vectors in voxelwise analysis to be continuous across voxels
use cblas_sgemm to compute correlation vectors instead of VecMatMultiply function
parallelize and do SIMD across voxels in the normalization step

1.5.5
more optimization in the normalization step, do omp across z-scorings to make sure each thread processes continuous data

1.5.6
optimize the SVM kernel matrix computing for Phi, using custom_ssryk routine

1.6
incorporate GPUSVM to replace LibSVM code
the first try, only for correlation-based voxel selection, works correctly but 5x slower than LibSVM

1.6.1
vectorize hot spots of GPUSVM, now outperform LibSVM by a factor of 2.7

1.6.2
further optimize GPUSVM, by 1) simplifying get max/min loops in first order heuristics; 2) avoiding using devCache in the precomputed kernel
now outperform LibSVM by a factor of 2.2 on Xeon and a factor of 5.7 on Xeon Phi

1.6.3
replace sgemm in correlation computing with customized blocking code

1.6.4
merging correlation computing and normalization together to deal with data piece by piece in L2 cache

1.7
merge the BETA version to the main branch
disable distance ratio methods for now
use voxelwise data structure to store the correlation data
for correlation based voxel selection, memory limitation of Xeon Phi is relaxed, but for correlation sum, memory limitation of Xeon Phi is not addressed
correlation based classification using top voxels is optimized for data normalization and kernel matrix computation
other parts remain the same
gcc 4.9 and/or icc 15.0 are recommended for compiling

1.7.1
added sending data by trial not all at once (MPI_Bcast 32-bit limit)
removed global 'using namespace std' from common header into local using statements
compiles using clang++ on os x again, ran llvm 3.6 static analyzer, added assertions & cleanup

1.7.2
further addressed 32-bit int issue by using longs where appropriate

1.7.3
change the SVM cross validation implementation in the correlation-based selection back to be LibSVM.
add MAXSVMITERATION (20,000,000) to restrict the SVM training from doing forever for some data (too many iterations won't help)

1.8
FCMA code refactor
move simplified LibSVM and PhiSVM code out from this repo, make them be dynamic libraries to be linked

1.8.1
Minor fixes and Makefile update
Makefiles now generate a debug and profile version (makes all by default or do "make debug" "make release" "make profile" to only make one)
Moved SVM paths from Makefile to Make.user by using OTHER_INCLUDES and OTHER_LDFLAGS
note: can use "patchelf" command to update pni_fcma's ELF data on Linux to include location of svm shared libraries in case LD_LIBRARY_PATH not set up

1.8.2
fix an INT_MAX bug in SVMPredictorWithMasks, use CMM_INT (long) to cast the numbers when they are big
replace LIBSVM with PhiSVM in SVMPredictorWithMasks

1.9
add functionality to output correlation matrix in HDF5 format
fix memory leak bugs when reading data, now FCMA can deal with datasets with high resolution fMRI images (91*109*91)
fix bugs correlation computation bugs when the two masks are not identical
